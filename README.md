Red-Black-Tree Visualizer

Description: A program that allows the user to build and view a red-black tree in the console.

Use: This is a visualization for the red-black tree, allowing the user to add, delete, search, or print the tree. The program will prompt the user if you want "ADD", "REMOVE", "SEARCH", "PRINT", or "QUIT". Enter your choice exactly as written in the prompt. If you choose ADD, enter the string of numbers in the console. If you choose REMOVE, specify the value you'd like to remove in the console. The print function will print out the tree and specify the colors of the nodes: 'r' = red, 'b' = black. This will allow the user to ensure that the tree is self-balancing appropriately.
